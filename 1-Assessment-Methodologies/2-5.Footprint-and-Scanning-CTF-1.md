# Objective

Perform reconnaissance on the target and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

**Flags to Capture:**

- **Flag 1**: The server proudly announces its identity in every response. Look closely; you might find something unusual.
- **Flag 2**: The gatekeeper's instructions often reveal what should remain unseen. Don't forget to read between the lines.
- **Flag 3**: Anonymous access sometimes leads to forgotten treasures. Connect and explore the directory; you might stumble upon something valuable.
- **Flag 4**: A well-named database can be quite revealing. Peek at the configurations to discover the hidden treasure.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ipconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and reachable
	- The machines are in the same subnet

- Checked the `robots.txt` file of the site

- Grabbed the FLAG 2 from `/secret-info/flag.txt`

- Ran `nmap -sS -A -T4 192.63.9.3` to conduct the initial scanning.

- Found the FLAG 1 from the results returned above.
- In the service scanning step, we found the FTP service allow anonymous login. Ran `ftp target.ine.local` command to log into the host via FTP and ran `ls` command to check the files on it.

- Ran `get flag.txt` to download the file and get the FLAG 3

- Ran scripts to test mysql service on the target: `nmap --script=mysql* -p 3306 -Pn target.ine.local`

- Tried logging into mysql with the account enumerated without providing a password. All failed

  <img width="756" height="392" alt="Footprinting and Scanning CTF 1 mysql logon failed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56b06d12-b2f4-4814-9dca-95c39135b648" />

- Reviewed the operation records and found an interested file on FTP server, `creds.txt`. Grab it and read it.

- Use the credential to log into MySQL and got the FLAG 4
