# Objective

Identify the services running on the machine, perform a detailed vulnerability scan, and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

**Flags to Capture:**

- **Flag 1**: Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.
- **Flag 2**: The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?
- **Flag 3**: A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?
- **Flag 4**: Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.

# Walkthrough

-  Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and pingable
	- The machines are in the same subnet

    <img width="1059" height="182" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 ping" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6913c683-2c24-4442-9ee9-2daca41e06a1" />

- Use nmap to do port and service scan with default scripts

- Use `curl` to view the `/.git/` directory and found sensitive file, `flag.txt`

- Obtained the flag 1

- Found potentially interesting directories in `robots.txt` file

  <img width="769" height="233" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 robots file" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2daae09c-81bd-466d-a0fe-a3f9f3d87357" />

- Under `/passwords/` directory, a few files including another `flag.txt` found

- Obtained the flag 4

  <img width="892" height="85" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 FLAG 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f5d982e-a00e-4e6c-bc98-b5cec44ed4e1" />

- Another directory `/phpmyadmin` also interest me, so I use `curl` to browse it too. It gave us lots of information

  <img width="1442" height="758" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 phpmyadmin" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54714d5c-9d5f-4507-82f2-f0b6d1eeafb8" />

- We use `searchsploit` command and found usable exploit in msfconsole for the version of phpMyAdmin

  <img width="1511" height="734" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 exploit search" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f39f9c77-51fb-43ad-b63a-937b4fdf01a0" />

- Another thing in `/phpmyadmin` page captured my attention is the variable setting, `var opendb_url = 'db_structure.php';`. So I tried finding it with `curl`, and we can see it redirected me to `/main.php`

  <img width="1486" height="401" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 db_structure" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d570e3-ad4b-4a2e-9763-a4a71ef35d12" />

- But before we run into any of them, we try the easiest way first by accessing `/phpmyadmin` directory via web browser first. Here we can browse the database without any security controls. And I found the flag2.

  <img width="1183" height="741" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 FLAG 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553c6cd9-683f-44fe-b52f-ff8042f5f0b6" />

- By reviewing the page source code, I found a php file, which matches the hint of the flag 3. It's `phpinfo.php`

  <img width="1492" height="257" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 phpinfo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f945c225-a9d8-4fa0-a22c-772697c54e2f" />

- Using `curl` and `grep` command, I found the flag 3.

  <img width="1497" height="283" alt="4-3  Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 flag 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/227b6f71-8309-4cc9-8a6b-a154fd234fc0" />
