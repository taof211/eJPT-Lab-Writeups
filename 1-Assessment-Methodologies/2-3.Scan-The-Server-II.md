# Objective

This lab covers the process of performing port scanning and service detection with Nmap.

The objectives of this lab are to:

- Identify the port running a Bind DNS server.
- Identify the port running a TFTP server.
- Identify the port running the SNMP server.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machine
	- The target machine is online and reachable
	- The machines are in the same subnet

- Ran `nmap -sS -sV -p- -T4 192.44.89.3` to identify open ports and serves running on them initially

- As both TFTP and SNMP that are in the objective not found, ran  `nmap -sU -sV 192.44.89.3 -p 1-250 -v. to find if any services running on UDP ports.

- Both SNMP and Bind DNS services have been found. Ran `nmap -sU -sV 192.44.89.3 -p 134 --script=discovery`,  `nmap -sU -sV 192.44.89.3 -p 134 --script=version`, and `nmap -sU -sV 192.44.89.3 -p 134 --script=tftp*` but not much useful information found.
  
- Checked the offical lab solution, and it said running `tftp 192.44.89.3.134` to directly authenticate with TFTP service on port 134. Hmmm it's not a way that I can accept.
  

# Key Finds

- I identified the Blind DNS Server is running on TCP 177 and UDP 177, SNMP Server is running on UDP 234, and TFTP Server is running on UDP 134.
- I hate the solution for TFTP service identification. Is there a more reasonable way we can use to identify it?
