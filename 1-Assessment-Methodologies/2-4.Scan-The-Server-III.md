# Objective

This lab covers the process of performing port scanning and service detection with Nmap.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and reachable
	- The machines are in the same subnet

- Ran `nmap -sS -sV -p- -T4 192.25.232.3 -v` and confirmed that there's no service's running on TCP ports on the target host

- Ran `nmap -sU -sV -p 1-250 192.25.232.3 -v` to seek any services running on UDP ports on the target host.

- Using default NSE to grab more information based on the service and port identified, `nmap -sU -sV -sC 192.25.232.3 -p 161 -v`

# Key Finds

- net-snmp SNMPv3 server (public) is running on UDP 161 on the target host.
- The OS architecture is x86_64, and the Linux kernel version is 6.8.0 with system uptime, 54m 49.12s
- TCP ports and UDP ports listening by net-snmp are listed
- Processes running on the host are listed
