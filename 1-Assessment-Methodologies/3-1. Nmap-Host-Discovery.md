# Objective

Your task is to discover available live hosts and their open ports using Nmap and identify the running services and applications.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and reachable
	- The machines are not in the same subnet

- Ran `nmap -Pn -sS -sV -T4 10.0.24.165` to conduct a port and service scanning.

# Key Finds

- Ports open and services are shown as the screenshot above.
- It appears that a firewall or packet filtering mechanism is deployed in front of the target machine, which selectively blocks SYN scans (`-sS`) on certain ports.
	- Attempts using ACK (`-sA`) and FIN (`-sF`) scan techniques also resulted in no responses, suggesting that the filtering applies to non-SYN traffic as well.
	- Additionally, fragmenting packets with the `-f` option did not bypass the filtering, indicating that the firewall is likely not stateful. Instead, the behavior suggests a stateless filtering mechanism such as an Access Control List (ACL), which drops packets based on static rules rather than connection state.
