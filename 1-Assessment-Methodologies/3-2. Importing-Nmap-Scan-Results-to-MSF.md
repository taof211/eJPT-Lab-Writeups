# Objective

To import Nmap scan results into MSF.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is not pingable
	- The machines are not in the same subnet

- Ran initial SYN ping to confirm the target is up because ICMP cannot be sent to the host  `nmap -sn -PS80,334,53,45,3389 10.0.19.182`

- Ran port and service scan and output the results into XML file, `nmap -Pn -sS -sT -T4 10.0.19.182 -oX target.xml`
