# Objective

 Perform the following tasks to complete the lab:

1. Check the present working directory on remote (exploited) machine.
2. List the files present in present working directory of the remote machine.
3. Check the present working directory on local (attacker) machine.
4. List the files present in present working directory of the local machine.
5. Get the flag value present in /app/flag1 file.
6. Change the flag value present in /app/flag1, so that no one else can get the right flag.
7. Change the present working directory to a suspiciously named directory in /app and read the flag from a hidden file present in that directory.
8. Get the flag5.zip to local machine, open it using password 56784. The information given in the extracted file will give clue about the location of the another flag.
9. Delete the .zip file from the directory.
10. Print checksum of file mentioned in the extracted file (Refer to Q8).
11. Check the PATH environment variable on the remote machine.
12. There is a file with string “ckdo” in its name in one of the places included in PATH variable. Print the flag hidden in that file.
13. Change to tools directory on the local machine.
14. Upload a PHP webshell to app directory of the remote machine.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and pingable
	- The machines are in the same subnet
