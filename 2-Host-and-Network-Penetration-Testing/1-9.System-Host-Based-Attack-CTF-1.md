# Objective

Perform system/host-based attacks on the target and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 target1.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and pingable
	- The machines aren't in the same subnet

    <img width="1001" height="217" alt="1-9  System-Host Based Attack CTF 1 ping 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cd01a67-38cf-4d71-8e44-effa3832b4d3" />

- Ran an nmap scan on the target host

- Launch and initial set up msfconsole

- In the nmap scan result, we can see the web page running on port 80 required authentication, so we try using `auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login` to do brute force attack against the user bob

- Then use `dirb` to brute force the directories in the website.

- Now use browser to view the directories identified. Found Flag 1

- Upload the webshell through `cadaver`. It was success

- Extract FLAG 2 through the webshell

- Now run another nmap scan targeting on the victim 2

- Back to msfconsole and do a brute force attack targeting the port 445

- Enter the session created with the administrator credentials

  <img width="1355" height="349" alt="1-9  System-Host Based Attack CTF 1 session" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf80523f-083c-4547-86a4-5a4b647e4de0" />

- Check shares available

  <img width="607" height="337" alt="1-9  System-Host Based Attack CTF 1 shares" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15fbf0b0-9ad3-4082-893b-d493aaf39aaf" />

- Check the files in the share `C$`

  <img width="1479" height="730" alt="1-9  System-Host Based Attack CTF 1 files" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa4d18c2-7ab2-493b-ac5f-3632274e4343" />

- Obtain the Flag 3

- Create a shell with the same session

  <img width="1321" height="426" alt="1-9  System-Host Based Attack CTF 1 shell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769a28e2-0c24-4de5-b221-537e44eac580" />

- Find flag 4

  <img width="772" height="691" alt="1-9  System-Host Based Attack CTF 1 Flag 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/634d9849-299c-4c0a-9b6b-6a1b12a501e5" />
