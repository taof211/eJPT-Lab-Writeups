# Objective

Answer the following questions:

1. What is the version of FTP server?
2. Use the username dictionary /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt and password dictionary /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt to check if any of these credentials work on the system. List all found credentials.
3. Find the password of user “sysadmin” using nmap script.
4. Find seven flags hidden on the server.

# Walkthrough

	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and pingable
	- The machines are in the same subnet
