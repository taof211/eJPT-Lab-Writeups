# Objective

Get a shell on the target by exploiting the vulnerable server using a suitable Metasploit module.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and pingable
	- The machines are in the same subnet
