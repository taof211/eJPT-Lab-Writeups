# Objective

To fingerprint the running RDP service, then exploit the vulnerability using the appropriate method and retrieve the flag!.

**Note:**Â rdesktop will not work on this setup as it does not support NLA. Please use xfreerdp to connect to the RDP server.

# Walkthrough

- Ran `ifconfig` and `ping -c 1 demo.ine.local` commands to identify the network information of the attack machine and the victim machine. Confirmed:
	- The IP addresses of both the machines
	- The target machine is online and pingable
	- The machines aren't in the same subnet

- Run a port and service scan with nmap

- Use msfconsole to verify if RDP is running on port 3333. Launch and use `auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner` module.

- Use hydra to conduct a brute force attack against the RDP service.

- Use xfreerdp to access the service

- Through the RDP session created, browse the file system on the target system and find the flag
