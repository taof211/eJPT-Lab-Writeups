# eJPTv2 Lab Walkthroughs & Cheatsheets ðŸš€

Welcome to my repository for the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPTv2) certification. This repository contains my detailed lab walkthroughs and custom cheatsheets compiled throughout my learning process.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project

This project serves as a portfolio of my hands-on lab work for the eJPTv2. The goal is to document my step-by-step processes for each lab and create a collection of quick-reference cheatsheets for essential tools and techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

- **/1-Assessment-Methodologies/**
- **/2-Host-and-Network-Auditing/**
- **/3-Host-and-Network-Penetration-Testing/**
  - These directories contain the detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs for each lab within the eJPTv2 learning path.
