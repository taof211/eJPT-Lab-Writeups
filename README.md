# eJPTv2 Lab Walkthroughs & Cheatsheets 🚀

Welcome to my repository for the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPTv2) certification. This repository contains my detailed lab walkthroughs and custom cheatsheets compiled throughout my learning process.

> **⚠️ SPOILER WARNING**
>
> Please be aware that each lab walkthrough file contains the final solution, including the flag, at the end. If you are also studying for the eJPT, I highly recommend attempting the labs on your own before consulting these solutions.

## 📌 About This Project

This project serves as a portfolio of my hands-on lab work for the eJPTv2. The goal is to document my step-by-step processes for each lab and create a collection of quick-reference cheatsheets for essential tools and techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

- **/1-Assessment-Methodologies/**
- **/2-Host-and-Network-Auditing/**
- **/3-Host-and-Network-Penetration-Testing/**
  - These directories contain the detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs for each lab within the eJPTv2 learning path.

- **/Cheatsheets/**
  - A collection of my personal quick-reference guides for common penetration testing tools and commands.
